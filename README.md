# 02_Bootstrap_CSS

This project is a responsive portfolio about myself based on reference images of how this project should look with minimual use of media queries.  Used semantic tags where applicable and a grid system of containers, rows, and columns.  Validation was succesfull on all pages.  Navbar and footer are consistent throughout.

I originally began this project under a different repo name *02_Bootstrap* then cloned and adjusted from there, now *02_Bootstrap_CSS*
